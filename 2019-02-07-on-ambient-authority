               On Ambient Authority

This pill discusses the concept of Ambient Authority.

Ambient: it's in the air around, just ready to be picked.

Authority: The right to use a resource.

This authority could be explicit: "here's the key to my car, be careful
with it" or implicit: "no need to ask if you want to charge your
phone, just plug it in". Or it could be literally ambient: "the air we
breathe".

The concept of ambient authority in computers is best explained with
an analogy.

Image you're in a supermarket. You have a basket in your left
hand. You walk around the aisles and pick the products you want with
your right hand and put those in your basket. At some point you decide
you have all you need and head for the checkout. You put all the items
on the conveyor belt. The cashier calculates the total price and you
pay. Then you take your items and leave.

What authorities are given to you by the supermarket?

1. browse the aisles.
2. collect products.
3. take them out. (paying changes ownership)

But there are more, you can:

4. leave products at different shelves;
5. eat the food before paying;
6. throw them on the ground (destroy items);
7. throw a whole shelve to the ground;
8. take your gun and shoot shoppers and employees;
9. detonate your nuclear bomb and destroy the entire supermarket.

The first three are expected behaviour that most people live up
to. The other six are unwanted behaviour in a supermarkt. But there is
nothing a shop owner can do to prevent you from doing. The shop owner
could report you to the police, but that's too late, the damage has
been done.

In computers it's just like that. You can:

1. browse your files
2. collect them in a zip file
3. mail these to a friend

The other rights also apply to computers, you can:
4. move files around;
5. change the files (edit documents, bomb some photos);
6. delete emails, photos, files;
7. delete folders;
8. stop processes (called 'kill' in linux);
9. reformat the hard disk and destroy everything on it.

Many processes need a just subset of the capabilities that an OS
provides. A game needs keyboard and joystick input, audio-video output
and some space on the disk to store the program and your progress. A
multiplayer game needs network connectivity to connect to the game
server.

You, as owner of the computer need the full nuclear option: Wipe the
whole disk, format it and start afresh with a better OS. :-)

In an ambient authority system, every process has all the power to do
everything, yet we expect them to behave. Most of them do, just like
people in the supermarket.

But there are processes that abuse the ambient authority.

In the next pill, I'll describe why ambient authority is not a good
choice for normal computer users.
