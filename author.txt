For a long time, I've been interested in computer security and
operating system architectures. I think that the POSIX-model has been
past its expiry date. It was good for professors and students at
universities in California but I think it is unsuitable for an
end-user anywhere else.

With Genode there is an architecture that promises a solid foundation
to build an operating system that solves many common problems such as
malware and crypto-extortion and could be simple to use for 'normal people'.
